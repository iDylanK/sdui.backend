# SDUI Typescript generator

## Getting started

### Installation 
There are 2 ways to get started:
- Install the SDUI npm dependency (in the future..).
- Clone this repo and locally import the root folder as a dependency to a project.
- Use the included sample_app, where this package is already installed as a dependency.


Creating a project schema:

- include the types from the library
- 


Search:
- Only local search is possible for now. Add a searchable string to a component. Can contain more keywords like this too.
- TODO: search via delegate.
- TODO: search via server.

Share
- 
- TODO: sharing images. expand the delegate to support this.


Generator (enums):
- TODO: implement project side. Generate all type functions.

## Contributing
The SDUI Swift Library needs to be installed (see XX).
Copy .nmprc.example to .npmrc and specify the SDUI Swift Library location.
